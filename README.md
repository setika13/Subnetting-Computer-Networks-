# Subnetting-Computer-Networks-
Subnetting is a process of dividing a single large network in multiple smaller networks.

# Implementation
Here, we simply implement the concept of subnetting using python as the programming language, where we simply enter the IP Address and number of hosts required, therefore getting the subnet mask as output.
